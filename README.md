 Binary Tree Implementation  

## Overview  
This project is a **binary tree implementation** designed for efficient data organization and retrieval. It includes various traversal algorithms, insertion and deletion methods, and optimizations for balanced trees.  

## Features  
- **Node Insertion & Deletion**: Add and remove nodes dynamically.  
- **Tree Traversal**: Supports **Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, and Level-order** traversals.  
- **Search Functionality**: Efficiently find elements in the tree.  
- **Balancing (Optional)**: Implementations of AVL Tree or Red-Black Tree for balanced operations.  
- **Visualization**: (If applicable) Graphical representation of tree structure.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python / JavaScript / C++ (Choose based on your implementation)  
- **Data Structures**: Binary Trees, BST, AVL (if implemented)  
- **Algorithms**: Recursion, DFS, BFS  

## Installation  
### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. For example, in Python:  
```bash
pip install matplotlib  # If visualization is included
```
  
### Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/realjioke/binary-tree.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd binary-tree
   ```
3. Run the script (for Python):  
   ```bash
   python binary_tree.py
   ```
4. If using a compiled language like C++:  
   ```bash
   g++ binary_tree.cpp -o binary_tree  
   ./binary_tree  
   ```

## Usage  
- Modify the script to insert values into the tree.  
- Run different traversal methods to explore the tree structure.  
- Customize balancing and search algorithms as needed.
